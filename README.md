# collapsing-toolbar-compose-multiplatform
Hey everyone! Here you’ll find a guide on how to implement a collapsing toolbar in Compose Multiplatform without using third-party libraries. Check out the README for details!

You can use this toolbar for your own dimensions—just replace them with the appropriate values. Also, keep in mind that the animation speed formulas are tailored for the example size (60.dp).

If you’d like to report a bug or have ideas on how to improve it, I’d be happy to discuss them with you!
